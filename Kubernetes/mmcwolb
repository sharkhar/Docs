sing a single load balancer (LB), even with HAProxy + Keepalived, still introduces a single point of failure if not properly configured for redundancy. Let's address that concern head-on and show how to eliminate the LB as a single point of failure in a multi-master Kubernetes setup.

✅ Solution: Eliminate LB as Single Point of Failure
Here’s how to fully avoid a single point of failure without using an external or single load balancer:

🔄 HAProxy + Keepalived on All Master Nodes
Instead of using one central HAProxy instance, each master (and optionally worker) runs:

HAProxy: Load balances locally to all API servers.

Keepalived: Manages the Virtual IP (VIP) used by all nodes to access the API.

🔌 How This Works
Every node uses the VIP (e.g., 192.168.1.100) to talk to the Kubernetes API.

The VIP "floats" between masters — if one master dies, another takes over.

Since HAProxy is running on every master, there’s no single load balancer to fail.

         VIP: 192.168.1.100

         +--> Used by all clients (workers, kubectl, etc.)
🛡️ Extra Fault-Tolerance
Even if 2 out of 3 masters fail, as long as one master and HAProxy are alive, the VIP will float and API access continues.

Optionally, you can also run HAProxy+Keepalived on worker nodes if you want workers to serve the VIP too.

✨ Optional (No VIP at All): Use DNS Round Robin + Health Checks
If you truly want zero SPOF and avoid VIPs or Keepalived altogether, another option:

Configure:
DNS A records:

api.k8s.local -> 192.168.1.10, 192.168.1.11, 192.168.1.12
Use local HAProxy on workers or kubelet config with retry logic.

Downside: No health checking — clients may hit a dead master.

Summary: How to Avoid SPOF in Multi-Master Kubernetes
Method	Single Point of Failure?	Notes
External LB	✅ Yes	Common, but centralized
HAProxy+Keepalived on all	❌ No	Most reliable for on-prem setup
DNS Round Robin	❌ No	Simple, but lacks health checks
etcd-only access per master	❌ No	Complex, but used in some bare setups
